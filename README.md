# Hybrid AI for Clinical Prediction: An Explainable and Robust Framework for Diabetes Classification

### Abstract
The rising global prevalence of diabetes necessitates accurate and early prediction models. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches often struggle with interpretabilityand leveraging rich, unstructured clinical insights. This paperintroduces a novel hybrid AI framework that combines a traditional ML model (Random Forest) with Large Language Model(LLM)-derived features for enhanced diabetes prediction. Weleverage Gemini to generate high-level, explainable features (e.g.,sentiment scores, keyword flags, and semantic embeddings) frompatient narratives, which are then integrated into a meta-learner.Our framework is evaluated on a combined dataset of PIMA Indians Diabetes and CDC BRFSS2015 data, demonstrating superiorperformance, achieving a recall of 0.715±0.017 and an accuracyof 0.81 ± 0.012 on unseen test data. Beyond performance, thehybrid model significantly improves explainability through SHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, revealing key featurecontributions from both traditional and LLM-derived sources.We also conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis, highlightingthe model’s equitable performance across demographic groups.This research provides a robust, explainable, and fair AI solution for clinical decision support, addressing critical needs fortransparent and responsible AI deployment in healthcare.Index Terms—Hybrid AI, Large Language Models, Explainable AI, SHAP, Diabetes Prediction, Clinical Decision Support,Fairness, Machine Learning.

### Repository Structure
To begin with the paper itself is in `Paper.pdf` - Read about our project there!

All the code you need to understand the paper is in `main.ipynb`. This notebook has all the information and detailed explanations of the code used in this research paper


All the datasets that were used in this project are in the `/content/` folder. The datasets you will find there are: 
 - The PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset - `pima-indians-diabetes.csv`
 - The CDC BRFSS2015 Dataset - which is split into 3 smaller .csv files:
   - `diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv`
   - `diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv`
   - `diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv`

The figures generated by the main Notebook (`main.ipynb`) are stored in `/figures/`. When you run the notebook, the new generated images will also be created in this folder. This folder contains all the confusion matrices generated and all the other plots/diagrams generated by the code.


The `/otherResources/` folder contains other information that you might find useful:
 - `/otherResources/Data/`
    - `gemini_preds.csv` - Contains the prompts fed to Gemini and the predictions that Gemini made
    - `diabetic_data.csv` - Contains the Diabetes_130 dataset. We generalized the code to the Diabetes_130 Dataset
 - `/otherResources/Code/`
     - Both the files in this folder were used earlier in the research proccess. Although they might look identical, they are both different from each other and from the main code. A lot of our testing and model improvements were conducted on one of these 2 files
